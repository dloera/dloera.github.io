            <h2 class="section-heading">UTF8 and Web 2.0</h2>
            <p>In week 4, we covered topics concerning UTF8, or characters, and the future of the Web of user-generated content, Web 2.0.</p>
            <h3>UTF8 </h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/unicode-over-60-percent-of-web.html">Here is my link to a google blog (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. </a><br>
                While I've known about ASCII and Unicode characters before in the use of alt-codes quite a bit, especially when trying to write things in another language (Spanish's use of the Ã± is useful), I'll admit I did not know the history of the system, and how it was developed. So learning this was quite interesting; it makes sense of the need for consolidating the different characters into one system, while solving the need for more characters, as all languages don't use the same characters. It seems that UTF-8 can even solve the inclusion of further character requirements quite astronomically, while still maintaining the same standards that ASCII was originally developed around. As the internet has become ubiquitous in our society, the rise of UTF-8 has allowed for communications around the world to become successful, while also maintaining backwards compatibility. Google has been using Unicode for quite awhile, and it's popularity has only increased over the years.

            <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
            <p>
                I don't believe that I have seen this video before, but boy does it bring me back 10-15 years. Has the internet really changed that much? I was interested in the concept of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a>, which is largely defined as the creation of websites where we share our information. Instead of creating a website that was only browsing, suddenly the idea of creating a platform to share those ideas became popular. This has led to the rise of things like Netflix, Facebook, Canvas, ... It is also largely predicated on the idea that we are selectively categorizing all of the content ourselves based on our searches, such as google. The second term I wanted to research from the video was <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html"> machine learning</a>, which are based on the algorithms created to take input from the external world, and allow the computer to search for the best solution to a problem. The reference in the video is largely based on Google (or at the time yahoo as well), of finding what the best served website for what a user is searching for.
